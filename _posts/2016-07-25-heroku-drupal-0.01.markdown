## Using the Lightning Distro of Drupal 8 with Heroku 
#### 0.01

For a new project, I decided to use [Acquia's](http://www.acquia.com/) ["Lightning" distribution](https://github.com/acquia/lightning-project) of [Drupal 8](http://github.com/drupal/drupal). The requirements for this project were not well defined at any stage and have continually shifted. At this point, the client has decided that [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) would be the best hosting option for them. I have set up a free Heroku installation

The first steps to work with Heroku was to install the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/). After creating a free account with Heroku, I then logged in through the terminal.
