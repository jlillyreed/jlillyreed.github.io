## Using the Lightning Distro of Drupal 8 with Heroku 0.01

For a new project, I decided to use [Acquia's](http://www.acquia.com/) ["Lightning" distribution](https://github.com/acquia/lightning-project) of [Drupal](http://www.drupal.com) 8. The requirements for this project were not well defined at any stage and have continually shifted. At this point, the client has decided that [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) would be the best hosting option for them. I have set up a free Heroku installation



Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
